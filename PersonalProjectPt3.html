        <h1>The Large Mouth Bass</h1>
        <p>
            Adult largemouth bass are solitary fish, 
            although occasionally several bass will congregate in areas with abundant food supplies. 
            They are usually the apex predator in their habitat. They will hide between rocks, 
            among water vegetation, or under roots and limbs of sunken trees, striking at their prey from the shadows.
